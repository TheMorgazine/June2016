# A Tale of Two Cakes


[](https://quip.com/-/blob/BSLAAAgurJT/AJHNqxrakjCeQFjwT8vvlA)

I noticed something interesting in my newsfeed history today. 

A year ago, I had shared an article from [Yahoo! and Good Morning America about a family which had ordered a cake for their daughter who was graduating from college, but the baker had gotten the instructions wrong](https://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/bakers-graduation-cake-mix-ends-purr-fect-mistake-002549970.html). The mother asked for the top of the cake to include a photo of her daughter, and if the cake decorator could “draw a cap on the top of her head.” But, the person taking the order heard *cat*, not cap, and that's how it turned out: with a cat drawn on top of the photo.
It was a mistake, but the family felt that it was a funny mistake. They just ran with it.


> "When I went to pick it up at the store, I could not stop laughing," said Carol Gambrel, 59. "I told them not to scrape it off. It was one of those young kids behind the counter and he seemed a little distracted with someone else ordering a cake a foot away from us. We went through the school colors and everything, and I said, 'Oh, could you draw a cap on her head?' And he gives me this look."


So, it was a mistake, but the mother at least recognized that she needed to own part of it because she had made the request, and perhaps she wasn't entirely clear. Communication, after all, is a two-way street.

I thought that this was interesting, because recently there was *another* story about a cake-gone-wrong that ended in a completely different way. A Kroger customer became angry when she discovered as she was picking up her son's birthday cake that it hadn't been done correctly. I'm not sure what exactly she didn't like about it, and perhaps nobody will know because the reports are that she drop-kicked the cake across the store.


> Dissatisfied with the decoration, she decided to go behind the bakery counter in an attempt to fix it herself.

> Store employees told the woman she wasn’t allowed behind the counter. Consequently, the cake went flying.


Is this a story about an apparent lack of quality in the cake baking industry? I don't think so. Everybody makes mistakes, and I'm willing to bet that both cases involved somebody behind the counter who made an honest mistake. I think that this is really a close look at the ways the different customers reacted to the mistake.

The situations for the customers are both somewhat similar. In both cases, the cake was for a son or daughter and in honor of a special day (how often are cakes made for an ordinary day?). So, you could probably imagine that both celebrations had brought on a reasonable amount of stress. And, during birthday and graduation parties the cake is often thought of as the centerpiece—so you need it to be right. Add another level of stress to the mother of the seven year old, however, because we all know how seven year olds can be about their birthday cake. If they *ask *for a “Batman-versus-Superman cake that's purple and yellow, with two layers, and the top layer is decorated to look like the interior of the batcave, but the second layer should be decorated to look like the streets of Gotham, and the batmobile should be driving down one of the roads chasing the Joker, plus oh yeah I want it to be vanilla flavored”—well, that's what they expect.

And, who knows what they did wrong on that cake. Perhaps it was as simple a misunderstanding as hearing “cat” instead of “cap.” For example, maybe they drew Batman with whiskers, or something. I don't know.

The one thing that the family from the first story got right is that in most problems, everybody is a contributor. This is perhaps a lesson the mother from the second story really needs to learn. Did she explain herself clearly enough? Was she really mad about the cake, or was there something else that was bugging her and she was really taking it out on both the cake and the Kroger employees?

And, I would have to say that another lesson is that when you step back and really think about it, a cake is really just a cake. Kroger probably would have done everything they could to make it right—perhaps by making a new cake, offering a refund, or something. The customer only needed to remain level headed and stayed opened to working things out. Drop-kicking the cake, or “dropping it” as she claimed later to police, doesn't really solve the problem. And, sure, your son might be upset that the cake isn't perfect, but he'll survive. He's seven.

Look at the family from the first story. This was a big moment for their daughter too, but they just laughed it off. Sometimes, you really just need to step back and chuckle a little bit.
